# Authentication

The Hero Api implements OAuth 2.0 to allow users to log in to applications without exposing their credentials. Api usage requires several steps:

1. Acquire an access token, and optionally refresh token
2. Put the access token in headers under `Authorization` key
3. Refresh the access token when it is about to expire



##Acquire an access token
##Authenticating requests
##Refresh access
##Invalidate access



> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
